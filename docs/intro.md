# Introduction

Welcome to the AI Robotics Book, a comprehensive guide to bridging artificial intelligence and physical robotics systems.

## About This Book

This book is designed for AI students transitioning into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It provides practical knowledge on connecting AI decision-making systems with physical robot control using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

## Modules

This book is organized into modules that build upon each other:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** - Understanding ROS 2 architecture as the middleware connecting AI logic to physical robot control
  - Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
  - Bridging AI Agents to Robots with rclpy
  - Humanoid Structure with URDF

## Target Audience

- AI students looking to transition into robotics
- Developers interested in physical AI applications
- Researchers working on humanoid robotics
- Engineers seeking to integrate AI systems with robot control

## How to Use This Book

Each module is designed to be completed independently but builds on previous concepts. Start with Module 1 to establish the foundational understanding of ROS 2 architecture before moving to more advanced topics.

The content includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
